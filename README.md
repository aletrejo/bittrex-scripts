# Bittrex Scripts
The **import.py** script imports cryptocurrencies prices from the [Bittrex API](https://bittrex.com/home/api) and stores them into a SQLite database. The **summary.py** script displays the daily return for each market found in the SQLite database. 

## Prerequisites
To run the scripts, you'll first need to have the requests and sqlalachemy libraries installed. Both can be installed with pip as follows: 

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pip install requests sqlalchemy 

```
Before running the scripts, you'll have to make sure you have a SQLite database. If you have another type of database, you'll first need to convert it into a SQLite database.  

## Usage 
### Commands 
```text
-d / --debug (Optional) Turns echo on so SQL statements generated by the script are printed to the terminal.
-h / --help  (Optional) Shows a help message.
database_path The path to the SQLite database that will be used to store and retrieve the data.
```
#### Using the database_path argument with a relative path vs an absolute path
For a relative path to your database, pass the argument as follows:
```bash
# Relative path
foo.db
```
For an absolute path, it's necessary to pass the argument with quotes surrounding it as follows:
```bash
#Absolute path:
#Unix/Mac
"/absolute/path/to/foo.db"
#Windows
"C:\path\to\foo.db"
```
### import.py usage
```bash
$ import.py --database_path
```

### summary.py usage
```bash
$ summary.py --database_path
```
 After running summary.py the output would be the following:
 
 ```text
BTC-1ST -0.07%
BTC-2GIVE -0.13%
BTC-ABY 0.00%
BTC-ADA -0.06%
BTC-ADT 0.04%
BTC-ADX -0.13%
BTC-AEON -0.08%
BTC-AGRS -0.01%
...
```
## Built with
* [Bittrex API](https://bittrex.com/home/api) - The API used to get the cryptocurrencies prices.
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) - The SQL engine used for the database.
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) - The Python library used for the database interactions.
